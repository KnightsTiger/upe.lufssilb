                    Wildlife Conservation in 1985. It became the location of a rich and flourishing ecosystem as many
                    birds and animals made their home amongst the wilderness. Untouched by humans and unseen from prying
                    eyes, the marshland became a haven for rare local and migratory birds, and a large number of insect
                    life. Seeds brought in by the birds also gave rise to many beautiful and rare flowering plants,
                    causing a number of butterfly species to visit the area.
